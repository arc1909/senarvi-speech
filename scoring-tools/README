## best-path-ppl.py

The tool best-path-ppl.py can be used to compute the perplexity of a language
model on a .trn transcript file in the presence of transcript alternations.
The language model probability is taken as the maximum over the different
paths through the transcript. If there are many alternations in the
transcripts, computation becomes slow without limiting the maximum number of
paths that are kept in memory at a time. The program can be run in the
following way:

  best-path-ppl.py LM-FILE TRN-FILE --max-alternatives=512


## interpolate-nbest-lmprobs.py

Interpolates LM probabilities in n-best list with new LM probabilities.

Takes as input an n-best list, which is in SRILM format, except that an
additional first column contains the utterance ID. The new LM probabilities
are read from another file that contains one log probability per line. Writes
a new n-best list to standard output, in the same format, with the LM scores
interpolated using the following formula:

  log(exp(score1 * scale1) * (1-lambda) + exp(score2 * scale2) * lambda))

All the log probabilities are base 10.
