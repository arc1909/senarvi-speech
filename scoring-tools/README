TOOLS FOR SCORING LANGUAGE MODELS

The tool best-path-ppl.py can be used to compute the perplexity of a language
model on a .trn transcript file in the presence of transcript alternations.
The language model probability is taken as the maximum over the different
paths through the transcript. If there are many alternations in the
transcripts, computation becomes slow without limiting the maximum number of
paths that are kept in memory at a time. The program can be run in the
following way:

  best-path-ppl.py LM-FILE TRN-FILE --max-alternatives=512

For the transcript file format, see:
